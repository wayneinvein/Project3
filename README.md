The Quiz Application is a simple yet interactive console-based Java program designed to test and enhance users' knowledge across three important domains in computer science: Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The app is user-friendly, offering an engaging and straightforward experience where users can answer multiple-choice questions and instantly see their scores. It allows users to retake the quiz for improved learning and performance. By presenting feedback in the form of a score, the app provides an excellent tool for self-assessment and knowledge reinforcement.

The application leverages several core Java concepts, including arrays to store and manage questions, options, and answers; control structures like loops and conditionals to control the flow of the program and validate user input; methods for organizing code and reusing functionality (like populating questions and answers); string handling for comparing user responses to correct answers; input/output handling using the Scanner class to capture user input; and primitive data types for storing user choices and scores. These Java concepts work together to create a seamless and efficient learning experience.
